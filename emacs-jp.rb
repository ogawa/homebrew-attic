      Because the official bazaar repository might be slow, we include an option for
      pulling HEAD from an unofficial Git mirror:

        brew install emacs --HEAD --use-git-head

      There is inevitably some lag between checkins made to the official Emacs bazaar
      repository and their appearance on the Savannah mirror. See
      http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git for the mirror's status. The Emacs
      devs do not provide support for the git mirror, and they might reject bug
      reports filed with git version information. Use it at your own risk.

      Emacs creates an executable `ctags` that stomps on exuberant-ctags. In
      order to prevent that, we remove `ctags` and its manpage from the emacs
      build before linking. (Add the flag "--keep-ctags" to keep it.) You can
      install exuberant-ctags via brew with `brew install ctags`.
      (exuberant-ctags can provide both vim-style and emacs-style tags.)
